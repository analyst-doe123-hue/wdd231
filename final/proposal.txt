Project Proposal  “National Parks Explorer” Website
1. Project Subject.

National Parks Explorer : A three-page website showcasing national parks, their features, and upcoming activities.

2. Project Description.

The National Parks Explorer website will be a dynamic, responsive, and accessible three-page site built with contemporary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ES Modules. The site will highlight categorized national parks, display park details from a local JSON data file, and provide user-friendly tools such as a gallery, event listings, and search/filter capabilities.

The website will include:

A Home Page (index.html) introducing the site and featuring a dynamic list of parks loaded using the Fetch API.

A Parks Gallery Page displaying detailed park information, images, and a modal dialog for extended descriptions.

An Events Page showcasing upcoming activities, filtered interactively using JavaScript.

A fully functional contact form with its own action page.

Local storage to store user preferences (e.g., dark/light theme).

Responsive navigation, lazy-loaded images, and strong accessibility/usability features.

3. Project Reason and Purpose.

The purpose of the National Parks Explorer website is to demonstrate mastery of this course’s learning outcomes by creating a real-world, meaningful web experience built with modern development techniques.

This project enables me to:

Apply valid, semantic HTML and CSS to build accessible pages.

Use JavaScript to fetch, process, and dynamically present JSON data.

Implement essential browser features such as local storage, modal dialogs, responsive design, and client-side interaction.

Follow performance optimization strategies learned in the course, including page weight control, lazy loading, and Lighthouse evaluation.

Practice professional skills such as organization, clear communication, and adherence to standards—skills expected in real development teams.

Overall, this project not only fulfills the technical requirements of WDD 231 but also allows me to create a polished, creative website that aligns with user experience principles and modern web development practices.
